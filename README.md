Created a blog posts microcomponent by creating a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin, and utilising the mySQLi extension to interact with the posts (add, insert, update and delete posts). Since the mySQLi extension is a procedural way of doing things, for the next project I'm going to try it the Object Oriented way and use the PDO(PHP Data Objects) extension to work with the database. I used XAMPP to run the Apache Web Server for PHP and the MYSQL database.
