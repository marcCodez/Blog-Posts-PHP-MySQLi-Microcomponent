Created a blog posts microcomponent by creating a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin, and utilising the mySQLi extension to interact with the posts such as add, insert, update and delete posts. Since the mySQLi extension is a procedural way of doing things, for the next project I'm going to try it the Object Oriented way and using the PDO(PHP Data Objects) extension to work with the database.
